Auto-Encoders from Keras using Tensorflow Backend

REQUIRMENTS:
 - Python3 environment with Keras using Tensorflow
 
SETUP:
Follow the 'Install Keras.pdf' in the repo or one of the many online tutorials to create a python environment that uses keras 

HOW TO USE:
 1) run one of the 5 programs
	 -  output loss (Training data) and val_loss (cross-validation) for each epoch
	 -  creates a plot of loss and val_loss over epoch

	 
ABOUT THE PROGRAM:
This program runs mimpliments multiple Auto-Encoders

This project will explore autoencoders. There is a tutorial from the Keras development team on how to build autoencoders with Keras. This project uses the code and logic from the tutorial as a basis and using the Fashion MNIST dataset (from the previous assignment) to build 5 autoencoder models.

The 5 autoencoders using the Fashion MNIST dataset are as follows:
 1)	A simple autoencoder based on a fully-connected layer
 2)	A sparse autoencoder
 3)	A deep fully-connected autoencoder
 4)	A deep convolutional autoencoder
 5)	An image denoising model
